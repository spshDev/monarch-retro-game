just a small retro-ish game where you are a king managing your kingdoms and stuff.
its just an idle clicker game where you click to get stuffs and use that stuffs to prevent famine, war and revolt
this is my first game which im like really proud of i made many games previously but im very proud of this one because this game actually has logic systems unlike the previous ones where its just physics based run jump etc
i am also very proud of the art style and shaders
was very fun to work on!
might work on it in future and add special event cards or just expand on it a little.
